    Morgan Lane asked if it was possible to use blanco with other address books, and
    it sure is.  All it requires is a small "ini" format file, and can easily be
    edited by hand or generated from another source.
    
    This would be much easier once 2d6 is fixed, as the format could look a little
    cleaner.
