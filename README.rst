``blanco`` - *"Hey, remember me?"*
==================================

Introduction
------------

``blanco`` is a simple tool to help you, or more specifically *me*. keep in
touch with people.  All it does is notify you if you're failing to keep in
contact.  It is just a quick solution to a simple problem, as long as you use
abook_ and your sent mail is easily accessible that is.

It is written in Python_ and licensed under the `GPL v3`_.

Bugs
----

If you find any problems, bugs or just have a question about this package either
drop me a mail_ or file an issue_.  Locally bugs are managed with ditz_, so if
you're working with a clone of the repository you can report, list and fix bugs
using ``ditz``.

If you've found please attempt to include a minimal testcase so I can reproduce
the problem, or even better a patch!
