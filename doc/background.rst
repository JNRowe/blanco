Background
----------

I'm one of those people who routinely forgets to keep in touch with friends,
mostly because there are no useful cues to use as a reminder.  :mod:`blanco` is
my attempt to fill that space, and stop losing track of people.  If you're the
kind of person who has a tendency to suddenly realise "oh wow, I've not spoke to
her for *over a year*" then :mod:`blanco` may be useful to you too.

The premise is simple: assign a "contact frequency" to a contact and let
:mod:`blanco` keep track of when you're drifting apart.  This is the sort of
thing that -- I suspect -- we would all like to handle without the need for
a specific tool, but life all too often just gets in the way of good intentions.
